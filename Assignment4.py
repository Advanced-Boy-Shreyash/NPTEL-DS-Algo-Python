# Write a Python function histogram(l) that takes as input a list of integers with repetitions and returns a list of pairs as follows:
#     > for each number n that appears in l, there should be exactly one pair (n,r) in the list returned by the function, where r is the number
#     of repetitions of n in l.
#     > the final list should be sorted in ascending order by r, the number of repetitions. For numbers that occur with the same number of
#     repetitions, arrange the pairs in ascending order of the value of the number.

# For Instance:
#     >>> histogram([13,12,11,13,14,13,7,7,13,14,12])
#     [(11, 1), (7, 2), (12, 2), (14, 2), (13, 4)]

# Que. 2
# A college maintains academic information about students in three separate lists

# Course details: A list of pairs of form (coursecode,coursename), where both entries are strings. For instance,
# [ ("MA101","Calculus"),("PH101","Mechanics"),("HU101","English") ]

# Student details: A list of pairs of form (rollnumber,name), where both entries are strings. For instance,
# [ ("UGM2018001","Rohit Grewal"),("UGP2018132","Neha Talwar") ]

# A list of triples of the form (rollnumber,coursecode,grade), where all entries are strings. For instance,
# [ ("UGM2018001", "MA101", "AB"), ("UGP2018132", "PH101", "B"), ("UGM2018001", "PH101", "B") ]. You may assume that each roll number and course code in the grade list appears in the student details and course details, respectively.

# Your task is to write a function transcript (coursedetails,studentdetails,grades) that takes these three lists as input and produces
# consolidated grades for each student. Each of the input lists may have its entries listed in arbitrary order. Each entry in the returned
# list should be a tuple of the form

# (rollnumber, name,[(coursecode_1,coursename_1,grade_1),...,(coursecode_k,coursename_k,grade_k)])

# where the student has grades for k â‰¥ 1 courses reported in the input list grades.

# The output list should be organized as follows.
# The tuples shold sorted in ascending order by rollnumber
# Each student's grades should sorted in ascending order by coursecode

# For Instance
# >>>transcript([("MA101","Calculus"),("PH101","Mechanics"),("HU101","English")],[("UGM2021001","Rohit Grewal"),("UGP2021132","Neha Talwar")],[("UGM2021001","MA101","AB"),("UGP2021132","PH101","B"),("UGM2021001","PH101","B")])
